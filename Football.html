        In recent years, Manchester City and Liverpool have been the standout clubs, with both having multiple league titles in the past decade,
        reflecting their success both domestically and in European competitions.
        Currently Manchester City are on a drought of wins, which their fans say that its because of the loss of recent ballon D'or winner,
        Rodri. With the current standings, Liverpool are the favorites to win the league with 12 matches and 31 points.
        Manchester United are rising up on the rankings due to the sacking of Erik Ten Hag and new head coach Ruben Amorim,
        who is leading Manchester United to victory, winning almost every match since his signing. A recent report has claimed that
        Liverpool and Arsenal are readying bids of around £50m to sign reported City target Martin Zubimendi in January.However,
        the report also adds that while Real Sociedad are willing to listen to offers for the midfielder in January, they are looking
        to get £60m for Zubimendi, but with the loyalty to Real Sociedad, Zubimendi may not be willing to transfer to the English sides.
        James Maddison's birthday was on the same day as Tottenham's last match against Man City, with Maddison scoring two goals and winning the match.

        Recently, in the league, Barcelona and Real Madrid have been dominating almost any team they meet, allowing them to be at the top of the league with Atletico
        in third place. Real Madrid's players have been getting injured left and right with Eder Militao having an ACL on his right leg and Vini Junior with a hamstring
        injury on his left leg. Vini blames the new schedule for his injury. Barcelona haven't won a match for three games. Hopefully they win the next match.
        Recently, after the signing of Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid have benn having some trouble with matches. Currently, they are 25th in the Champions League but
        are still strongly holding on to the second place in Laliga. In the last El Classico Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 with Mbappe being caught offside
        8 times. Atletico Madrid has made a few decent signings this transfer window, bringing in 2022 World Cup winner, Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth both
        as centre forwards. Manchester United have made contact with Sevilla over promising defender Juanlu Sanchez. Girona have signed striker Bojan Miovski
        from Aberdeen in a deal worth £6.8m. Girona have taken the Laliga by storm
